# [Oriented R-CNN for Object Detection](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05699)

## Introduction

Current state-of-the-art two-stage detectors generate oriented proposals through time-consuming schemes.
This diminishes the detectorsâ€™ speed, thereby becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection systems.
This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented detector with promising accuracy and efficiency.
To be specific, in the first stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free manner.
The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them.
